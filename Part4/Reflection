Reflection (5 points)
Most Challenging Part: The most challenging part of the workflow is, without a doubt, Part 2: Data Strategy (Data Collection & Preprocessing). Real-world medical data (like EHRs) is notoriously "messy." It's not in a clean table; it's spread across different systems, full of missing values, and often includes unstructured clinical notes. Defining the right features (feature engineering) and, more importantly, rigorously addressing the ethical and bias concerns before any modeling begins, is the most difficult and highest-stakes part of the process. A mistake here invalidates the entire project.

Improvement with More Resources: With more time and resources, my primary improvement would be to incorporate unstructured data. I would use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract features from the free-text clinical discharge notes. These notes contain rich context that structured data misses, such as "patient lives alone," "reports feeling anxious about discharge," or "has strong family support." These human-centric factors are often the most predictive of readmission, and building a model that understands them would be a significant improvement.
